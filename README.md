## Project Name
**Travel Planner**
### How to start this project
Make sure you have Node.js and npm already installed.
Follow this if you have not: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-and-install-node-js-and-npm/
In your terminal, simply type the following:
```
npm install
```

If you run into any dependency errors, check what the errors say. 
If an error mentions a specific package/dependency as missing or not found, ensure that it shows up in your `package.json` file.
This can be done automatically!
Assume you didn't have `react` and `react-dom` installed, do the following in your terminal: 
```
npm install react react-dom
```
Doing the above will automatically update `package.json` with the necessary code to allow running `npm install` and automatically downloading any/all paclages needed.

Lastly, do the following:
```
npm run dev
```

Then, in a browser, open `localhost:5173`. You should not open `index.html` in a browser.
React works differently than traditional web programming! 
When you save your changes, they appear in the browser automatically.
### Project Abstract
The project is a web-based platform designed to manage the process of planning for a trip.

### Customer
<!--A brief description of the customer for this software, both in general (the
population who might eventually use such a system) and specifically for this
document (the customer(s) who informed this document). Every project will have a
customer from the CS506 instructional staff. Requirements should not be derived
simply from discussion among team members. Ideally your customer should not only
talk to you about requirements but also be excited later in the semester to use the
system.-->

### Specification
<!--A detailed specification of the system. UML, or other diagrams, such as finite
automata, or other appropriate specification formalisms, are encouraged over
natural language.-->
<!--Include sections, for example, illustrating the database architecture (with,
for example, an ERD).-->
<!--Included below are some sample diagrams, including some example tech stack
diagrams.-->
